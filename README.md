AI explains GLSL Shader Art as..
>GLSL shader art refers to the process of creating artistic effects or visuals using GLSL shaders, which are programs that run on a graphics processing unit (GPU) and are used to manipulate and render 3D graphics on the computer screen. GLSL shaders can be used to create a wide range of visual effects such as lighting, shadows, reflections, and more, making them a powerful tool for creating immersive and dynamic 3D visuals. GLSL shader art is often used in video games, computer-generated imagery (CGI) and visual effects, and other interactive media.
